## 🚀 Problem Statement

Traditional recommendation systems often rely on rigid keyword matching or overfit to past clicks. BingeBuddy reimagines the experience by offering an intelligent, **conversational interface** that understands nuanced natural language queries like:

- "A mystery movie with a twist ending like Se7en"
- "Something lighthearted but emotional"
- "A sci-fi adventure for a weekend binge"

---

## 🧠 Core Features

### 🤖 Conversational AI Interface

- Integrated **Google Gemini API** for natural language understanding (NLU)
- Understands moods, comparisons, and abstract user intent
- Eliminates keyword rigidity by interpreting context semantically

### 🔍 Precision Search Pipeline (2-Stage)

- **Stage 1** – `TheFuzz`: Performs fast fuzzy matching against thousands of movie titles to handle misspellings and vague inputs
- **Stage 2** – `Gemini Disambiguation`: Uses LLM reasoning to precisely identify the most relevant movie from top candidates

### ⚡ Performance-Optimized Recommendation Engine

- **TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity** matrix (Scikit-learn) for fast, scalable inference
- Vectorized recommendation logic with precomputed similarity scores
- Reduced API latency by 80% with **batched vectorized calls** to Gemini, replacing N:1 architecture

### 🎨 Modern UI/UX

- Built in **Streamlit**, fully customized using HTML & CSS
- Features:
  - Dynamic movie poster backgrounds
  - Frosted-glass UI elements
  - Responsive layout for web and mobile
