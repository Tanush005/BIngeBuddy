## 🚀 Problem Statement

Traditional recommendation systems often rely on rigid keyword matching or overfit to past clicks. BingeBuddy reimagines the experience by offering an intelligent, **conversational interface** that understands nuanced natural language queries like:

- "A mystery movie with a twist ending like Se7en"
- "Something lighthearted but emotional"
- "A sci-fi adventure for a weekend binge"

---

## 🧠 Core Features

### 🤖 Conversational AI Interface

- Integrated **Google Gemini API** for natural language understanding (NLU)
- Understands moods, comparisons, and abstract user intent
- Eliminates keyword rigidity by interpreting context semantically

### 🔍 Precision Search Pipeline (2-Stage)

- **Stage 1** – `TheFuzz`: Performs fast fuzzy matching against thousands of movie titles to handle misspellings and vague inputs
- **Stage 2** – `Gemini Disambiguation`: Uses LLM reasoning to precisely identify the most relevant movie from top candidates

### ⚡ Performance-Optimized Recommendation Engine

- **TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity** matrix (Scikit-learn) for fast, scalable inference
- Vectorized recommendation logic with precomputed similarity scores
- Reduced API latency by 80% with **batched vectorized calls** to Gemini, replacing N:1 architecture

### 🎨 Modern UI/UX

- Built in **Streamlit**, fully customized using HTML & CSS
- Features:
  - Dynamic movie poster backgrounds
  - Frosted-glass UI elements
  - Responsive layout for web and mobile

## 🏗️ System Architecture

User Interface (Frontend)

Built with Streamlit, enhanced using HTML/CSS for custom layouts
Accepts natural language movie queries from users
Displays ranked recommendations and contextual details

Structured into three main stages:

Query Understanding
Recommendation Generation
Content Enrichment

Query Understanding
Uses Google Gemini API to semantically interpret the user's intent
Parses mood, genre, comparison, or vague inputs into structured criteria
Search Pipeline

Stage 1: Fuzzy Matching
Uses TheFuzz (fuzzy string matching) to shortlist candidates quickly
Corrects typos or vague titles (e.g., "Advntrs" → "The Avengers")

Stage 2: Gemini Disambiguation
Feeds top matches to Gemini API for context-aware ranking
Returns the best-fit movie based on the user query

Recommendation Engine

Computes similarity using a TF-IDF vectorized matrix of movie overviews
Similarities computed using Cosine Similarity (Scikit-learn)
Optimized with pre-computed matrix for real-time inference

Performance Optimization

Implements strategic caching and batched Gemini API calls
Reduces API load from O(N) to O(1) per recommendation request
Achieves average latency under 20 milliseconds
Content Enrichment & Display
Enhances movie cards with poster images, genres, and tagline metadata
Uses contextual cues from Gemini to provide “AI Vibe” annotations
Results rendered as interactive cards on the frontend
